This personal website is a little project to introduce myself to the world of programming, while enabling me to blog about my random ideas and experiences. I am totally new to this, but hopefully this can build a little foundation in web development from which I can use to apply my interests. 

On a macro level I'm interested in contributing to an environmentally sustainable future. I'm specifically interested in China's development of alternative energy systems.

I graduated from UCLA in 2014, and am now in Yunnan, China.
