Found this really helpful video from [Greentech Media][GTM] that does a great job summarizing the future outlook of the cleantech industry in the US, particularly for photovoltaics. 

Obama's Clean Power Plan energy targets will be a huge boost for the industry, but there is a four year gap between 2016 and 2020 where the Solar Investment Tax Credit ends and early action incentives in the Plan come into effect. This gap is predicted to have a significant negative impact on project deployment and overall growth of the industry.

The [Solar Energy Industry Association \(SEIA)][seia], the main lobby group for the industry, is mobilizing efforts to convince congress to extend the tax credits until the energy targets begin taking effect.
